            <h1>CMSC 22</h1>
            <h3>My Favorite CMSC Subject</h3>
            <p>
                I enjoyed CMSC 22 over other CMSC subjects because it uses Java and it's the first time I've used a object-oriented programming language. Well, technically,
                Python is considered an object-oriented programming language, but so far I've only used it as a procedural programming language. Java was interesting to me
                because it was different from the way I programmed before. Sadly, the class was cut short because of COVID-19 and I didn't really learn much.
            </p>
            <h1>ETHICS 1</h1>
            <h3>My Favorite GE Subject</h3>
            <p>
                I find philosophy and questioning life and the Universe fascinating. That's why I love ETHICS 1. Learning about how to live a virtuous life and learning about
                the different philosphies to live a happy life are some highlights.
            </p>
            <h1>C</h1>
            <h3>My Favorite Programming Language</h3>
            <p>
                Even though my favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22, my favorite programming language so far is still C because I like how much more complicated C is than Python
                and that it looks way more professional.

            <h1>CALAMARES</h1>

                Calamares. Calamares. Calamares. Calamares. Calamares.

            <h1>PALEONTOLOGIST</h1>
            <h3>Childhood Dream</h3>
            <p>
                I used to really like dinousaurs and fossils, and then I found out that there were no dinosaurs in the Philippines so that destroyed my dreams as a kid.
